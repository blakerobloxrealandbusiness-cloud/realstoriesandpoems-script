story 1: The goblin’s teeth were green. Not mossy or algae-stained, but the vivid, unnatural green of poison, and Tripp had just noticed this detail as the creature lunged for his ankle. He kicked out instinctively, his boot connecting with the goblin’s jaw with a wet crack. The thing screeched, rolled twice in the dirt, and came up snarling.

Phoebe sighed, adjusting her grip on the hilt of her sword. "Could you *not* antagonize them before we know how many there are?" she muttered, scanning the treeline. The forest around them was eerily still, save for the occasional rustle of leaves—too rhythmic to be the wind.

The goblin was still hissing when something streaked down from the sky—a blur of iridescent blue, moving faster than Tripp could blink. He barely had time to register the hooked claws before they snatched him by the shoulders, lifting him clean off the ground.

Phoebe didn't think—she moved. The dragon's tail whipped past her as it surged upward, and she leapt, fingers scrabbling against shimmering scales. For one terrifying second, she hung there, feet kicking empty air, before she hooked a leg over the ridged spine and clung on like a burr. "Tripp!" she roared, but the wind swallowed her voice as the beast banked sharply, wings snapping open to catch the updraft.

Tripp's stomach lurched as the dragon corkscrewed through the clouds, its wings slicing the air with predatory grace. He could feel the heat of its scales through his tunic, smell the acrid musk of its breath—like burned copper and old blood. Below, the forest shrank into a patchwork of green and brown, and then vanished entirely as the beast cleared the ridge. The world tilted again, and suddenly there it was: the city, sprawled across the valley like a dropped crown, its walls glinting in the noon sun.

The dragon's shadow rippled over the city walls, and the screaming started—not the scattered shouts of a few startled guards, but a rolling wave of pure, undiluted panic. "AHHHHHHHHH!" came the first voice, raw and unhinged, followed by a chorus of others. Tripp caught glimpses of faces upturned below, mouths stretched wide, fingers pointing. Someone dropped a basket of apples. A child wailed.

The dragon banked hard left, and Tripp’s grip slipped—just enough for him to see the shadow pooling beneath them. Not another dragon. Not a cloud. Something flat and disc-shaped, humming like a hive of pissed-off bees, keeping pace with them twenty feet below. Goblins crouched on its surface, their grimy fingers hooked into grooves Tripp couldn’t see from this angle. One of them grinned up at him, needle-teeth glinting, and raised a crossbow.

Phoebe’s shout was lost in the wind, but Tripp didn’t need to hear it. He let go.

Tripp hit the goblin craft feet-first, the impact jarring his knees. The disc-shaped platform wobbled under his weight, its surface slick with something that smelled like rancid grease and wet mushrooms. The goblin with the crossbow screeched—not in alarm, but in delight—and leveled its weapon at Tripp's chest. He didn't give it the chance. Pivoting on his heel, he drove his elbow into the creature's throat, then grabbed its wrist and twisted until the crossbow clattered to the metal plating. The goblin's grin faltered.

"Bad idea," Tripp spat, and kicked it square in the ribs. The creature sailed off the edge with a wail, limbs flailing as it tumbled toward the distant treetops. Two more goblins lunged at him from behind, their claws raking at his cloak. Tripp ducked, feeling the fabric tear, and rolled sideways just as a rusted blade whistled past his ear. The dragon—Phoebe still clinging to its back—banked hard overhead, its shadow briefly eclipsing the sun. Tripp didn't hesitate. He sprinted toward the edge of the disc, planted one foot on the rim, and launched himself into open air.

The wind howled past Tripp's ears as he plummeted, arms flailing—then, with a sudden, violent gust, it *shoved* him sideways like an invisible hand. His ribs slammed against the dragon's flank, knocking the breath from his lungs. Scales bit into his palms as he scrabbled for purchase, legs kicking wildly. Above him, Phoebe's fingers clamped around his wrist, her teeth bared in a snarl of effort. "Grab the—*gods*, Tripp—*the spine!*" she yelled, barely audible over the wind.

He hooked an arm around one of the ridged protrusions, muscles screaming as he hauled himself up. The dragon shuddered beneath them, wings flaring to compensate for the sudden weight shift. Tripp's boot slipped, and for one heart-stopping second, he dangled by one arm, the world spinning below him in a dizzying blur of sky and distant ground. Then Phoebe's knee jammed against his ribs, pinning him to the beast's side as she wrenched him upward.

The dragon's wings carved through the air with a sound like tearing parchment as it descended toward Concordia Path—a stretch of road so unnervingly straight it seemed to vanish into the horizon, swallowed by the same haze that blurred the distant mountains. Tripp's fingers ached where they dug into the dragon's scales, the heat of them seeping through his gloves. Phoebe, pressed flat against the beast's spine ahead of him, twisted just enough to lock eyes with him, her expression a mix of exhilaration and raw terror. Neither of them had expected the dragon to *listen* when they'd shouted directions—let alone understood human speech—but here they were, clinging to a creature that had, for reasons unknown, decided to cooperate.

Concordia Path rushed up to meet them, the cobblestones gleaming dully under the dragon's shadow. Then, with a deafening *crack*, the beast veered upward at the last second, its talons raking through the road's surface like claws through wet clay. Chunks of stone erupted into the air, pelting Tripp's back as the dragon surged skyward again, its wings beating hard against the updraft. Phoebe's shout was lost in the chaos, but her grip on the spine never faltered. The road below wasn't just broken—it was *changed*. Where the dragon's claws had struck, the stones now glowed faintly, veins of molten gold threading through the rubble like a spider's web.

The dragon's wings folded like collapsing sails as it touched down in a clearing just beyond Concordia Path, its claws sinking into the soft earth with surprising gentleness. Tripp felt the shift in the creature's muscles before it happened—a ripple of tension, then deliberate slack—and then he was sliding, the world tilting as the dragon lowered itself enough for them to dismount. Phoebe hit the ground first, knees buckling slightly before she caught herself. Tripp followed, stumbling forward as his boots met dirt instead of scales. When he turned, the dragon was already lifting its great head, nostrils flaring as it sniffed the wind.

For a heartbeat, it looked at them—really *looked*, those molten gold eyes holding something too knowing to be animal. Then, with a sound like a sigh, it pushed off, wings unfurling with a snap that sent dust devils spinning across the grass. Tripp took a half-step forward, hand outstretched, though he didn't know what he meant to do. Stop it? Thank it? The dragon didn't glance back. It climbed into the sky with effortless grace, shrinking against the clouds until it was just a speck, then nothing at all.

Tripp let his hand drop as the dragon vanished into the sky, his fingers twitching with the ghost of an impulse he couldn’t name. "We could whistle," he said suddenly, turning to Phoebe. "You know—like that shepherd in Brinwall. The one who called his damn sheepdog from three leagues away."

Phoebe wiped sweat from her brow, her sword still unsheathed and glinting in the sunlight. "You think a *dragon* is going to come back because you puckered your lips and made a noise?" She kicked a pebble, watching it skitter across the broken cobbles of Concordia Path. The molten veins in the stone pulsed faintly, like a dying ember.

Tripp’s lungs burned as they sprinted down the slope toward the village, the dragon’s departure still ringing in his ears. The place was alive in a way that felt almost mocking after the chaos they’d just survived—smoke curled from chimneys, a blacksmith’s hammer clanged against anvil, and somewhere, a goat bleated indignantly. A man in a patched tunic paused mid-swing, his axe buried in a log, and stared at them with the blank curiosity of someone who hadn’t just watched a dragon tear up the road.

Phoebe skidded to a halt, her boots kicking up dust. "Are they *serious*?" she hissed, gesturing at a woman calmly weaving a basket under a willow tree. The woman glanced up, blinked, and went back to her reeds.

The carrot was upside down. That was the first thing Tripp noticed—its feathery green leaves buried in the dirt, the pale orange root sticking straight up like some absurd vegetable flagpole. The villager tamped the soil around it with the solemnity of a grave digger, then wiped his hands on his thighs and nodded at his handiwork.

Phoebe's sword tip hovered inches from the man's kneecap. "You've got ten seconds to explain why you're planting carrots like a lunatic," she said, voice edged with the kind of calm that preceded violence.

The villager blinked at Phoebe’s sword, then at the upside-down carrot, then back at Phoebe. His face cracked into a grin missing three teeth. "Ain’t lunacy if it works," he said, tapping the carrot’s exposed root with a grimy fingernail. "Keeps the blight off. Learned it from them green folk."

Tripp’s boot scuffed the dirt as he stepped forward. "Green folk?"

The villager's grin widened, revealing gums the color of spoiled meat. He jerked his chin toward a crooked hut at the edge of the village, its roof sagging under a thatch of moss and what looked like—Tripp squinted—*bones*. Small ones. Bird, maybe. "Green folk live there," he said, scratching his armpit. "Came down from the mountains after the blight started. Said they'd fix things if we listened." He waggled his eyebrows at the upside-down carrot. "Turns out they ain't *wrong*."

Phoebe's sword didn't waver. "You let strangers plant nonsense in your fields and didn't ask questions?"

The villager said that he threw away plant after plant until the green folk showed him how to bury them upside down—roots kissing the sky, leaves buried like secrets. "Lost half my crop 'fore that," he muttered, nudging the carrot with his toe. "Then them greenies come along, poke their fingers in the dirt, and say *turn 'em round, turn 'em round*. Like it was the easiest damn thing in the world." He spat into the dirt, narrowly missing Phoebe's boot.

Tripp crouched, studying the carrot. The soil around it was darker than the rest of the field, almost black, and it *moved* when he looked too closely—not worms, but something finer, like ink dispersing in water. He reached for it, then yanked his hand back as a tendril of shadow lashed up, snapping at his fingers like a whip. "Okay," he said slowly. "That's new."

The hut's door hung crooked on its hinges, swaying slightly in a breeze that smelled like wet earth and something sour—fermenting, maybe. Tripp nudged it open with his boot, the wood groaning like a wounded animal. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of charure and charredn cooked greens, undercut by a metallic tang that made his tongue curl. Five pairs of luminous yellow eyes snapped up from the rough-hewn table, their owners mid-bite, green-tinged juice dripping from their chins.

Phoebe's sword was already halfway out of its sheath when the smallest goblin—no taller than a terrier—let out a delighted shriek and hurled a half-eaten carrot at her head. She dodged, but not fast enough; the vegetable smacked against her shoulder, leaving a smudge of vivid green sludge. "Oh, you're *dead*," she muttered, shaking the gunk off her sleeve.

The carrot slid off Phoebe's sleeve with a wet plop, and she lunged before it even hit the dirt. Her sword hilt cracked against the smallest goblin's skull with a sound like a walnut splitting. The creature's eyes rolled back, and it crumpled mid-screech.

Tripp didn't bother with weapons. He grabbed the edge of the wobbling table and flipped it skyward, sending bowls of green slop arcing through the air. Three goblins went down under the landslide of wooden crockery, their limbs flailing like overturned beetles. One tried to scramble free, its clawed fingers digging into the dirt floor—Tripp stomped on its wrist, felt something crunch, and grinned at the resulting howl.

The last goblin slumped face-first into the dirt, its twitching fingers still clutching a rusted spoon. Phoebe wiped her blade clean on its tunic—not out of spite, but practicality. The thing had been eating something that smelled like fermented toenails, and she wasn’t about to let that gunk gum up her steel.

Tripp nudged one of the unconscious goblins with his boot. "Think they’ll wake up angrier?"

Phoebe tossed the bundle of leather and metal at Tripp’s feet with a thud that kicked up dust. "No," she said, as if the word alone could armor-plate her resolve. She nudged the pile with her boot, revealing glints of polished steel beneath the wrappings. "You take it. I’m keeping mine."

Tripp crouched, peeling back the layers to reveal a cuirass etched with winding silver veins—goblin work, no doubt, but finer than anything he’d seen in the village smithies. The leather straps were supple, the buckles unrusted. "Where’d you even—"

"They were stuffed in their pants," Phoebe said, flicking a glob of green sludge off her gauntlet. "Like some kind of demented pantry." She toed the unconscious goblin at her feet, its oversized trousers sagging around its knobby knees. The fabric was patchwork—bits of stolen velvet and burlap stitched together with what looked like human hair. 

Tripp hooked a finger into the goblin's waistband and recoiled instantly. "Gods, it's *damp*." He wiped his hand on the hut's wall, leaving a streak of something unidentifiable. "Why would they—no, actually, I don't want to know."
